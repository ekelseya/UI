    <h1>Gestalt Psychology and User Centered Design</h1>
    <p>
        In his book <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/design-everyday-things">
        The Design of Everyday Things</a>, Don Norman says “good designs fit our needs so
        well that the design is invisible.” [1] Author Steve Krug argues that good design
        should lighten the user’s cognitive load in
        <a href="https://www.peachpit.com/store/dont-make-me-think-revisited-a-common-sense-approach-9780321965516">
            Don’t Make Me Think
        </a> [2]. User Interaction and User Experience (UI/UX) Design uses the principles of
        human perception to create designs that are intuitive to the point of being invisible.
        These principles were first proposed over one hundred years ago by Gestalt Psychologist
        Max Wertheimer. The world of technology may have changed significantly since then, but
        the basics of human perception remain the same.
