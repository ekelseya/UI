<h1>Induced Grouping</h1>
<p>
    Grouping can be induced by placing elements with no basis for grouping in proximity to
    those with their own grouping relationships [5]. Conversely, induced grouping can be
    disrupted by “using common region to put the inducing set into a separate region of
    space” [5]. This can be the most powerful grouping principle and should be used
    carefully; there are ethical considerations to induced grouping. Contextual advertising
    uses the principles of induced grouping to create ads that look like posts from friends
    in Facebook or Twitter feeds [10]. This can be very effective, but also invites criticism.
