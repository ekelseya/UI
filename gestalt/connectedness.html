<h1>Element Connectedness</h1>
<p>
    Connecting distinct elements with a third element effectively competes against other 
    grouping principles [5]. The power of this principle can be seen in studies of patients 
    with Balintâ€™s syndrome who can only perceive one object at a time. When patients were 
    presented with a screen showing two circles, they reported seeing only one. However, 
    when the circles were connected with a line, the patients could perceive both objects [15].
