<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>
    Humans are wired to see our surroundings in terms of the whole [4]. We donâ€™t see the
    world as individual elements. Instead we see the gestalt of these elements: the box,
    not the lines of its edges; the flock, not the individual birds; the navigation bar,
    not each word or icon. User Interface/User Experience Design must be built on the
    principles of human perception. The best design is designed for the user, not despite
    the user.
