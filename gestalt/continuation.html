<h1>Good Continuation and Closure</h1>
<p>
    “The eye tends to build a relationship between elements, it fills in the gaps, and
    identifies hidden motion in the design.” [13] Wertheimer suggested that good continuation
    could be seen when a segment proceeds in a direction that “carr[ies] on the principle
    logically demanded” from the original element [5]. The eyes will follow a shape, even
    beyond its end point, until its logical conclusion.

    Closure is the ability of the human mind to fill in gaps. We try to close open figures
    to perceive it as a whole object, rather than separate features. This can be seen when
    Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) represent collections of objects as stacks, with one
    whole object showing and the edges of others “behind” it [4].
