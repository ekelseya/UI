<h1>Proximity and Common Region</h1>
<p>
    The principle of proximity states that objects that are closer to each other appear
    related. Objects that are farther apart do not. In a set of studies in the late 90s,
    Michael Kubovy demonstrated what became known as pure distance law. He showed that no
    matter the orientation, grouping depended only on the relative distance between dots [5].

    In UI/UX design, on-screen controls or data displays are often grouped in boxes. However, 
    the proximity principle shows that items can be visually grouped by spacing them closer
    together than other controls, without visible borders. This use of whitespace to reduce 
    visual clutter in a user interface is recommended by graphic design experts [4].
