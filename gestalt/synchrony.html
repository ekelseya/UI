<h1>Synchrony</h1>
<p>
    Synchrony can be thought of as common fate through time. Visual elements that appear
    at the same time are grouped together, even if they break other principles, such as
    color, proximity, and size [13]. Flashing bulbs are perceived as a group, even when
    arranged within unlit bulbs. In 1999, Lee and Blake showed that temporal synchrony of
    changes in elements randomly distributed distinguishes the grouped elements [14].
    Bottlenecks author David Evans describes advertisements inside slideshows, with
    arrows designed to resemble the button to click for the next slide, as a perfect
    example of synchrony used to trick the viewer.
