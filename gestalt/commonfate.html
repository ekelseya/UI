<h1>Generalized Common Fate</h1>
<p>
    The classic principle of common fate was described with reference to motion: “Elements
    that move in the same direction are perceived as more related than elements that are
    stationary or that move in different directions.” [11] This can be seen in dropdown
    menus, accordions, and drawers, but it can also be implied through shading. Buttons in
    UI/UX design are often shaded to look three dimensional; this conveys a sense of motion
    into the 3D world. Studies in the early 2000s have demonstrated that common fate grouping
    can be affected by common direction of luminance changes [5].
