<h1>Psychology and Human Perception</h1>
<p>
    In the early twentieth century, psychologist Max Wertheimer theorized that the mind and
    body could not be separated when observing how people perceive their surroundings. This
    led to the field of Gestalt psychology and the foundation for modern views of perception:
    “Gestalt theory emphasized that the whole of anything is greater than its parts [3].”
    We view our surroundings not piecemeal but in terms of whole objects [4]. Gestalt
    psychologists identified what are now known as the classic principles of perceptual
    grouping [5].

    Figure 1 shows some of these classic Gestalt principles of grouping [5].
</p>
<ul>
    <li>a.	No grouping</li>
    <li>b.	Proximity</li>
    <li>c.	Color</li>
    <li>d.	Shape</li>
    <li>e.	Size</li>
    <li>f.	Orientation</li>
    <li>g.	Common fate</li>
    <li>h.	Symmetry</li>
    <li>i.	Parallelism</li>
    <li>j.	Good continuation</li>
    <li>k.	Closure</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Modern perceptual and cognitive psychologists have refined these classic ideas to create
    new principles of grouping, quantified by measures of phenomenological psychophysics [6].
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Common region</li>
    <li>Synchrony</li>
    <li>Element connectedness</li>
    <li>Induced grouping</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Together, these principles create a framework for effective UI/UX design.
