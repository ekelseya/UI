<h1>Similarity Grouping</h1>
<p>
    Elements that share common visual properties often belong together. This is the basis for
    the Gestalt grouping principle of similarity. Wertheimer seemed to favor a general
    principle of similarity, describing it as “the tendency of like parts to band together.”
    [5] In UI/UX design this can be further broken down into color, size, and shape.

<h2>Color</h2>

<p>
    In UI/UX design, color theory, the set of principles regarding the use of color, focuses
    on the aesthetic appeal of a design message [7]. However, in Gestalt principles, color is
    the easiest and strongest tool to affect similarity. Figure 3 shows how color creates a
    stronger grouping than even shape [8].

<h2>Size</h2>

<p>
    Size is another important tool for creating similarity. This can be seen in typography
    where larger fonts are easily recognized as headers, giving users subconscious clues to
    classify important points. The Nielsen Norman Group tracked how people scan webpages.
    They found a “Layer-cake pattern” where readers scan the headings and subheadings
    clearly indicated by size [9]. Using clear headings and subheadings, grouped by size,
    allows users to quickly identify relevant information.

<h2>Shape</h2>

</figure>
<p>
    Shape has the weakest grouping effect, but it can still have a profound effect on the
    user. Consider the “lozenge” in Microsoft Office 2007 (Figure 5). Its shape and position
    implied it was a non-functioning logo and not an important part of the menu. The lozenge
    was retired in 2010 and replaced with the File menu [10].
